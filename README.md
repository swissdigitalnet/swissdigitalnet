We started to build a wirintegrated digital network for Switzerland independent from the internet.
It is:
- Wireless
- Integrated. I supports end-to-end services like data transfer, mail, chat, voice, and information kiosk
- It should cover Switzerland
- and have a link to the worldwide internet (through satellites)

Its purposes are:
- Learing and fun with (mainly) TCP/IP technology, backbones, and meshes.
- Emergency network for the community
-
